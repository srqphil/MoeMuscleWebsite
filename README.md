# MoeMuscleWebsite
This was a final project for my Advance Website Development class.

This a simple responsive website made for a fictional personal trainer. Made with HTML and CSS. 

Website has homepage, image gallery, blog, contact and about me pages. This was my first website project. I learned a lot about CSS Grid and Flexbox for making responsive websites.
